# [Mastering Web Development Code](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mastering-web-developer-interview-code-2/stay-sharp-with-web-developer-interview-code)

This is the repo for my class from LinkedIn Learning by Ray Villalobos. I really like Ray's style of teaching. I have already taken one of his ReactJS classes and this was a suggested follow up class. Really liking it right now. I find that writing my thoughts down on a README doc is helpful to process my code. Maybe someone else will too? Either way, this is the style of learning that I currently enjoy. I don't always have notes or comments on some of the videos but if I do they are below.

## Question One: How do you use the data- attribute in HTML?

This took a little bit of time getting the repo running. What I was seeing on screen wasn't exactly how things were layed out in the repo I cloned down. For instance, the CSS link in the HTML was referring to a different location than the cloned repo had it. I decided to create my own files and use the cloned repo as reference. I always like to follow along with my own files when doing these classes.

Once I had the files set up, I was able to get into the class. The `data-` attributes were really interesting to play around with. I really like how Ray builds off of something and keeps showing you more ways to get the most out of your code. The final part of the video showed this by using a script to change the background of two of my buttons. So cool!

## Question Two: Are you comfortable using jQueary?

The first thing I noticed was that the CSS file was missing. I went and got it from Bootstrap so that the styles would be the same as the video.

The rest of the class was very straight forward but I really liked how Ray commented on the end of his scripts. I often get confused about what `)}` is connected to what. So watching him do that was really helpful and I plan to implement that extra bit of effort to make my code more understandable.

## Question Five: Have you used Ajax to load an external file?

I remember in one of my Bootcamp projects, we used a JSON file to dynamically load images and text at the click of a button. This reminded me of that project and I really like the concept of being able to have data load this way. I had not seen the `readyState === 4` code before, so that was fun to learn about.

## Question Six: Have you used JavaScript templates?

I honestly didn't expect my code to work as I followed along. I thought I'd be missing a npm package or the `<%` bits weren't going to work for reasons I can't explain. Its really neat to see how this works. Now I want to see if I can use it on my own projects. I am wondering if I need to create the `ejs.js` file with my own data or if I just need to create the `data.json` file. We shall see!
