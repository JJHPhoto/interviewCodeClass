# interviewCodeClass

Repo for my class "Mastering Web Developer Interview Code" from LinkedIn Learning.

I really like Ray's style of teaching. I have already taken one of his ReactJS classes and this was a suggested follow up class. Really liking it right now.

## Question One: How do you use the data- attribute in HTML?

This took a little bit of time getting the repo running. What I was seeing on screen wasn't exactly how things were layed out in the repo I cloned down. For instance, the CSS link in the HTML was referring to a different location than the cloned repo had it. I decided to create my own files and use the cloned repo as reference. I always like to follow along with my own files when doing these classes.

Once I had the files set up, I was able to get into the class. The `data-` attributes were really interesting to play around with. I really like how Ray builds off of something and keeps showing you more ways to get the most out of your code. The final part of the video showed this by using a script to change the background of two of my buttons. So cool!

## Question Two: Are you comfortable using jQueary?

The first thing I noticed was that the CSS file was missing. I went and got it from Bootstrap so that the styles would be the same as the video.

The rest of the class was very straight forward but I really liked how Ray commented on the end of his scripts. I often get confused about what `)}` is connected to what. So watching him do that was really helpful and I plan to implement that extra bit of effort to make my code more understandable.
